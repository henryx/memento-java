Memento backup system
----------------------

Link: http://code.google.com/p/syncropy

Description:
------------

Memento is a backup system for remote machines. It is similar of other systems
(e.g. rsnapshot) but it has some differences:

 - It use an agent for check and download data.
 - It manage four distinct datasets (hour, day, week, month).
 - It save space with hard link creation.
 - It save data attribute (owner, group, permission, ACL) into database.

Licence:
--------

Memento is released under GPLv2 (see GPL.txt for details)

Dependencies:
-------------

 - Java 1.7;

Installation:
-------------

Just extract code into a directory and use it

Server usage:
------

Usage is simpliest:

$ java -jar Memento_-_Server.jar --cfg=<cfgfile> -H # hour backup
$ java -jar Memento_-_Server.jar --cfg=<cfgfile> -D # day backup
$ java -jar Memento_-_Server.jar --cfg=<cfgfile> -W # week backup
$ java -jar Memento_-_Server.jar --cfg=<cfgfile> -M # month backup

Where <cfgfile> is a file structured like the syncropy.cfg reported in the
archive. For other options, use -h switch. Some notes:

 - It is possible to have multiple configuration files, where each file has
   different parameters.
 - While general sections is global, it is possible to set any number
   of sections, one per server.

This is an example of configuration file:

[general]
repository = /var/backups/servers

log_file = logfile.log
log_level = INFO

[dataset]
hour = 24
day = 6
week = 4
month = 12

[server1]
host = 192.168.1.100
port = 4444
path = /home
store_acl = yes

[server2]
host = 192.168.1.101
port = 4444
path = /home/foo
store_acl = no

Caveats:
--------

Because Memento use hard links to store its dataset, its use is guaranteed on
linux or unix environments.
